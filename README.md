## 📝 Description

An Excalidraw clone with React and TypeScript. Rough.js is used for the sketchy, hand-drawn style. I built the side project for learning purposes. The app is not responsive. I mainly focused on the functionalities since I already have plenty of projects that are responsive.

## 🦄 Features

Here's what you can do with Cool Drawer App:

- **Choose a Tool**: You have pencils, lines, rectangles, and text tools. Pick one and start creating.

- **Draw and Move**: Click and drag on the canvas to draw. To move something, select it and drag it to a new spot. Also, resize elements by dragging the corners. Resizing only works on rectangles or lines.

- **Edit Text**: Click on the canvas and start typing to add text to your drawings. You can also edit existing text.

- **Zoom**: Use Ctrl + Scroll or click on the buttons to zoom in for detail or out to see the whole picture.
